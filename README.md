# Chapter 21. Pagination
## Summary
- Pagination allows large collections of results (or large single resources) to be consumed in a series of bite-sized chunks rather than as a single large API response using three special fields: maxPageSize , pageToken , and nextPageToken .
- If there are more pages, a response will include a nextPageToken value, which can be provided in the pageToken field of a subsequent request to get the next page.
- We rely on a maximum page size rather than an exact page size as we donâ€™t know how long it will take to fill a page exactly and must reserve the ability to return even before a page of results is fully populated.
- Paging is complete when a response has no value for the next page token (not when the results field is empty).
## Exercises
- Why is it important to use a maximum page size rather than an exact page size?
- What should happen if the page size field is left blank on a request? What if itâ€™s negative? What about zero? What about a gigantic number?
- How does a user know that pagination is complete?
- Is it reasonable for page tokens for some resource types to have different expirations than those from other resource types?
- Why is it important that page tokens are completely opaque to users? Whatâ€™s a good mechanism to enforce this?
